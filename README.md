# Jack compiler
### written in C++, succesfully passed all the provided test files using the provided VMEmulator
**notes**
-Building the compiler in Project 10 and 11 was the most hardest out of all Projects in Nand2Tetris. The course and the book gives a decent amout of format for you to work on but you need to think and figure a lot of the things along the way. It will definatly make your understanding of the compiler deeper and deepen your knowleadge of the programming language of your choice.
-Make sure you read the lecture slides and the book while you are developing the project. The nand2tetris forum will also help you substantially.

-I figured a way to use one character at a time as I thought it was the intened way but parsing line by line could work.
2.Compilation Engine
-This is where most of your code will be. There is no right way of writing this part. One tip would be trying to implement partially by doing the tests one by one.
